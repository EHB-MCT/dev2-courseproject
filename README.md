## Sources 🗃️
- [Multi auth in Laravel](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50514738/multi-auth-use-one-page-login-laravel) used in http > controller > LoginController.php (line 18-67)
- [Audio from ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/0ce262ad-0ca5-4d1d-a454-469ec446c374) used in resources > music
- [Chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com) ⚠️ this is an invalid example, because it links to a homepage instead of a specific page or issue
- Generate a ChatGPT share link: options (three dots) > share. This will not work if you have uploaded images in your prompt. In that case, add screenshots instead
- If your lecturer still sees these default examples, you're in trouble
